ng-admin-ui is a nice and simple admin interface written in AngularJS, plug-in your back-end APIs in order to persist data to your database.

ng-admin-ui uses the following open source libraries:

1. ui-router https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router
2. SB Admin 2.0 (bootstrap admin interface) https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/
3. Angular Loading bar: http://chieffancypants.github.io/angular-loading-bar/

2. List: Display a list of items in a grid (kendo-ui grid provided as example only)
